    """Part of an evolutionary algorithm applying only the variation part
    (crossover, mutation **or** reproduction). The modified individuals have
    their fitness invalidated. The individuals are cloned so returned
    population is independent of the input population.

    :param population: A list of individuals to vary.
    :param toolbox: A :class:`~deap.base.Toolbox` that contains the evolution
                    operators.
    :parents: dictionary keeping record of parents of generated individuals.
    :param lambda\_: The number of children to produce
    :param cxpb: The probability of mating two individuals.
    :param mutpb: The probability of mutating an individual.
    :returns: The final population.

    The variation goes as follow. On each of the *lambda_* iteration, it
    selects one of the three operations; crossover, mutation or reproduction.
    In the case of a crossover, two individuals are selected at random from
    the parental population :math:`P_\mathrm{p}`, those individuals are cloned
    using the :meth:`toolbox.clone` method and then mated using the
    :meth:`toolbox.mate` method. Only the first child is appended to the
    offspring population :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`, the second child is discarded.
    In the case of a mutation, one individual is selected at random from
    :math:`P_\mathrm{p}`, it is cloned and then mutated using using the
    :meth:`toolbox.mutate` method. The resulting mutant is appended to
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. In the case of a reproduction, one individual is
    selected at random from :math:`P_\mathrm{p}`, cloned and appended to
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`.

    This variation is named *Or* because an offspring will never result from
    both operations crossover and mutation. The sum of both probabilities
    shall be in :math:`[0, 1]`, the reproduction probability is
    1 - *cxpb* - *mutpb*.
